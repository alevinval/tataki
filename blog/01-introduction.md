## The problem space

Let's start one example, a yearly dentist visit.

- It's a recurrent event (on a yearly basis)
- It's re-scheduled after completion (by the dentist)
- It's not going to be precisely re-scheduled after 365 days (depends on the dentist agenda)

Another example, renewing a digital certificate to electronically access government sites.

- It's a recurrent event (after 8 years it expires)
- It's re-scheduled after completion (when you complete the process)
- You want it renewed anywhere between 6 to 3 months in advance (in case something goes wrong)
- You don't want to miss the renewal, otherwise physically visit the office to expedite a new one

More examples, cleaning the VAC units filters.

- It's a recurrent event (once every year)
- It's re-scheduled after completion (after you're done)
- You don't care about postponing it (not urgent)
- You only do house-keeping during the weekend (annoying task)
